# Social Credit 31

A social credit tracking system for students and classes, made as an April Fools' joke.

## âœ¨ Techstack

I wanted to try a lot of new technologies so I decided to use:
- [Alpine.js](https://alpinejs.dev/) - very lightweight frontend framework
- [RSpack](https://rspack.dev/) - faster alternative to vite
- [Supabase](https://supabase.com/) - there is no custom backend, only postgress + supabase auth
- [Biome](https://biomejs.dev/) - all in one alternative for eslint, prettier and @eslint/stylistic

*I know that it would be way easier if I'd use something different, but it was fun to play with...*
