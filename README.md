# Social Credit 31

A social credit tracking system for students and classes, made as an April Fools' joke.

## âœ¨ Techstack

I wanted to try a lot of new technologies so I decided to use:
- Alpine.js - very lightweight frontend framework
- RSpack - faster alternative to vite
- Supabase - there is no custom backend, only postgress + supabase auth
- Biome - maybe better alternative for styling and linting

*I know that it would be way eaisier if I'd use something different, but it was fun to play with...*
